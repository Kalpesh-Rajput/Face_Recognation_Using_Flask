# Face Recognition Web App with Machine Learning in Flask

![Alt Text](https://github.com/Kalpesh-Rajput/Face_Recognation_Using_Flask/blob/main/Kalpesh/Face_.jpg)


This project uses Flask to create a web application for face recognition, powered by the face_recognition library and OpenCV. It identifies faces in images or videos and displays results in real time.

## Features
- Detect and recognize faces from images or video streams.
- Interactive web interface for uploading images or using webcam.
- Uses face_recognition for accurate facial recognition.
- OpenCV and haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml for face detection.
## Libraries & Technologies
- Flask – Web framework for the application.
- face_recognition – Library for recognizing and manipulating faces.
- OpenCV – For computer vision tasks like face detection.
- haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml – Pre-trained classifier for frontal face detection.
